    <h3> List any 5 semantic tags in html along with their discription ?</h3>
    <p>
        Here are five commonly used semantic HTML tags along with their descriptions.
        <ol>
            <li> <header> The </header> tag represents the introductory content or a container for a set of navigational elements in a document or section. It typically contains the site logo, page title, and primary navigation.</li>


            <li>
                <nav>The <nav> tag represents a section of a page that contains navigation links, such as a menu or a list of links to various parts of the website. It helps in organizing and identifying the navigation elements on a web page.

                </li>
            <li>
                <main> The <main> tag represents the main content of a document. It should typically be unique to the document and must not contain content that is repeated across a set of documents, such as site navigation or footer information. Each HTML document should ideally have only one <main> element.
            </li>
            <li>
                <article>The <article> tag represents a self-contained composition or a discrete piece of content within a document. It can be a blog post, a news article, a forum post, or any other independent content block that can be distributed or syndicated.


            </li>
            <li>
                <footer> The <footer> tag represents the footer section of a document or a section. It usually contains information about the author, copyright notice, links to related documents, or contact information. The footer is typically placed at the bottom of the page.
