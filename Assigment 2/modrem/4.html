    <p>
        mproving the accessibility of HTML involves making design and development choices that enhance the usability and inclusivity of web content for individuals with disabilities. <br> Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:
        <ol>
            <li>Use Semantic Markup: Utilize semantic HTML elements appropriately to provide a clear structure and meaning to the content</li>
            <li> Provide Alternative Text for Images: Ensure that all images have descriptive alternative text (alt text) specified using the alt attribute</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is important to follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </li>
        </ol>
