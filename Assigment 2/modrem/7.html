            Improved Accessibility: Semantic tags provide meaningful structure to web content, which helps assistive
            technologies such as screen readers to understand and navigate the page more accurately. This enhances
            accessibility for users with disabilities, allowing them to access and comprehend the content effectively.

            Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines rely on the structure and meaning of HTML elements to
            understand and index web pages. By using semantic tags, you provide clear indications of the page's
            structure and content, which can improve search engine rankings and visibility.

            Code Readability and Maintainability: Semantic tags make the HTML code more expressive and self-explanatory.
            By using tags like <header>, <nav>, <article>, and <footer>, the code becomes more readable and easier to
                            understand, both for developers working on the project and for future maintenance or
                            updates.
        </li>
        <li>

            Future-Proofing: Semantic tags are designed to be forward-compatible. This means that as new elements and
            standards are introduced in HTML, using semantic tags ensures that your web content will remain compatible
            and can easily adapt to future changes and updates.
