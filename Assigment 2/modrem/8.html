        <h3>What is HTMl ?</h3>
        <p>
            HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web
            pages and applications. <br> It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a set of markup
            tags that define the various elements and their attributes.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the benefits of using sematic tags in our webpage ?</h3>

                Improved Accessibility: Semantic tags provide meaningful structure to web content, which helps assistive
                technologies such as screen readers to understand and navigate the page more accurately. This enhances
                accessibility for users with disabilities, allowing them to access and comprehend the content
                effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines rely on the structure and meaning of HTML elements to
                understand and index web pages. By using semantic tags, you provide clear indications of the page's
                structure and content, which can improve search engine rankings and visibility.

                Code Readability and Maintainability: Semantic tags make the HTML code more expressive and
                self-explanatory.
                By using tags like the code becomes more readable and easier to
                understand, both for developers working on the project and for future maintenance or
                updates.
            </li>
            <li>

                Future-Proofing: Semantic tags are designed to be forward-compatible. This means that as new elements
                and
                standards are introduced in HTML, using semantic tags ensures that your web content will remain
                compatible
                and can easily adapt to future changes and updates.
