    <h3>Write a short note on the tab index ?</h3>
    <p>

        Tab index is an attribute used in web development to specify the order in which elements can be navigated using
        the keyboard's tab key. <br> When a user presses the tab key, the focus moves from one interactive element to another
        on a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tab index attribute can be applied to a variety of HTML elements, such as links, form fields, buttons, and other interactive elements. <br> It assigns a numerical value to each element, indicating its position in the tab order. br
        Elements with a lower tab index value are visited first when the tab key is pressed, followed by elements with higher tab index values.
