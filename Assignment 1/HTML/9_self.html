<body>
    Self-closing tags, also known as empty tags or void elements, are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag because they do not enclose any content. Instead, they represent standalone elements or elements that do not have any nested content. These tags are closed by placing a forward slash ("/") before the closing angle bracket (">").

Common examples of self-closing tags include:

<br>: Represents a line break, used to create a line break within a paragraph or to add spacing between elements.
<img>: Represents an image element and is used to display images on a webpage.
<input>: Represents an input field, such as a text input, checkbox, or radio button.
<meta>: Represents metadata about an HTML document, including information such as character encoding, viewport settings, and keywords.
