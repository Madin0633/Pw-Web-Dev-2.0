    In Emmet, the nesting operator is a powerful feature that allows developers to quickly and efficiently express
    nested HTML or CSS structures using a concise syntax. It enables the creation of complex nested structures in a
    single line of code.

    The nesting operator in Emmet is represented by the > character. It indicates the parent-child relationship between
    elements or selectors. By using the nesting operator, developers can define the hierarchy of nested elements or
    selectors in a compact and intuitive manner.

    Here's an example of how the nesting operator works in Emmet

    ul>li>a
