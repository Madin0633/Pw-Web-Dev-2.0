    Global attributes in HTML are attributes that can be applied to any HTML element. These attributes provide common
    functionality and behavior across different elements. Here are five examples of global attributes:

    id:
    The id attribute uniquely identifies an element within an HTML document. It is used to reference and manipulate
    specific elements using JavaScript or CSS. The id value must be unique within the document.

    class:
    The class attribute is used to assign one or more CSS classes to an element. It allows for the styling and targeting
    of multiple elements with the same class using CSS or JavaScript.

    style:
    The style attribute is used to apply inline CSS styles to an element. It allows for the direct application of CSS
    rules, such as setting colors, fonts, margins, and more, without the need for an external CSS file.

    title:
    The title attribute provides additional information about an element. It is often displayed as a tooltip when the
    user hovers over the element. The content of the title attribute should provide a concise description or explanation
    of the element's purpose.

    data-*:
    The data-* attributes allow developers to store custom data within an element. The asterisk (*) can be replaced with
    any name to create a custom data attribute. These attributes are commonly used to store additional information or
    data associated with an element, which can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript.

    These are just a few examples of global attributes. Global attributes provide flexibility and consistency in HTML by
    offering a set of common attributes that can be applied to various elements across different web pages.
