    Tags, Elements, and Attributes in HTML

    In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags, elements, and attributes play a crucial role in structuring and defining
    the content of a web page. Here's a short note on each of these concepts, along with relevant examples:

    Tags:
    Tags are the building blocks of HTML and are used to define different elements within a web page. They are
    represented by opening and closing brackets (< and>) surrounding a keyword. Tags can be classified into two types:
        container tags and empty tags.
        Container tags: These tags have an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag to enclose the content they
        define. For example:

        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        Empty tags: These tags do not have a closing tag and are used to insert specific elements into the page. For
        example:
        <br> (line break)
        <img src="../Blog/1.jpg" height="250px" alt="Description"> (image)

        Elements:
        Elements are created by enclosing content within tags. An element consists of an opening tag, content, and a
        closing tag (for container tags). Elements define the structure and semantic meaning of the content on a web
        page. Some common elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
        Example of a heading element:

        <h2>This is a subheading</h2>
        Example of a paragraph element:

        <p>This is a paragraph with some text.</p>
        Attributes:
        Attributes provide additional information or modify the behavior of an HTML element. They are placed within the
        opening tag of an element and consist of a name-value pair. Attributes provide details such as the source of an
        image, the destination of a link, or the size of an element.
