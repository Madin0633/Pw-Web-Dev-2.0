    Heading Tag:
    The tag is used to define the main heading of a web page. It represents the highest level of heading and
    typically provides a clear and prominent title for the content. The heading levels range from <h1> (most
        important) to (least important). The content enclosed within the <h1> tags is usually displayed in
            a larger and bolder font by default.

            <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

            <p> - Paragraph Tag:
                The
            <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text. It represents a block-level element and is commonly used to
                structure and separate different sections of textual content on a web page. The content enclosed within
                the
            <p> tags is typically displayed as a separate paragraph with appropriate line breaks and indentation.
            </p>
            <a> - Anchor Tag:
                The <a> tag, also known as the anchor tag, is used to create hyperlinks within an HTML document. It allows you to link to other web pages, files, sections within the same page, or external resources. The destination URL is specified using the href attribute within the opening tag. When the user clicks on the link, they are redirected to the specified URL.
                    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
