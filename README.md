# Full Stack Web Development Projects

This repository houses my full stack web development projects. I have set up a comprehensive collection of projects in this repository, utilizing different front-end and back-end technologies. I have organized each project into separate branches within this repository.

## List of Projects

1. **Blog Website**: This project encompasses the front-end and back-end code for my personal blog website. I have built the front-end using React.js and the back-end using Node.js and Express.js.

2. **E-commerce App**: In this project, I have developed an e-commerce app where users can browse products, add products to the cart, and process orders. I have built the front-end using React.js and the back-end using the Django framework.
